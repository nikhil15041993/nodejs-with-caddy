## Create a Nodejs Application
2. Now, letâ€™s create a testing application (we will assume it has a client and admin side which share the same database), the microservices will run on ports 3000, and 3001 respectively.

```
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/app
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/adminside
$ sudo vim /var/www/html/app/server.js
$ sudo vim /var/www/html/adminside/server.js
```
Next, copy and paste the following pieces of code in the server.js files (replace 192.168.43.31 with your server IP).


```
##mainapp code
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '192.168.43.31';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	res.statusCode = 200;
  	res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  	res.end('This is the Main App!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  	console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
##adminside code
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '192.168.43.31';
const port = 3001;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	res.statusCode = 200;
  	res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  	res.end('This is the Admin Side!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  	console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

## Install PM2 Product Process Manager in Linux
3. The latest stable version of PM2 is available to install via NPM as shown.

```
$ sudo npm i -g pm2 
```
4. Once PM2 installed, you can start your node applications using following commands.

```
$ sudo node /var/www/html/app/server.js
$ sudo node /var/www/html/adminside/server.js
```
Note that, in a production environment, you should start them using PM2, as shown (you may not need sudo command if your app is stored in a location where a normal user has read and write permissions).

```
$ sudo pm2 start /var/www/html/app/server.js
$ sudo pm2 start /var/www/html/adminside/server.js
```

To list all your node application (process/microservices), run the following command.

```
$ sudo pm2 list
```


## To view details of a single Node process as shown, using the process ID or name.

```
$ sudo pm2 show 0
```

## How to Manage Node Apps Using PM2 in Linux
9. The following is a list of some common process (single or all) management commands you should take note of.

```
$ sudo pm2 stop all                  		#stop all apps
$ sudo pm2 stop 0                    		#stop process with ID 0
$ sudo pm2 restart all               		#restart all apps
$ sudo pm2 reset 0		         	#reset all counters
$ sudo pm2 delete all                		#kill and remove all apps
$ sudo pm2 delete 1                 		#kill and delete app with ID 1
```


## To manage application logs, use the following commands.

```
$ sudo pm2 logs                      	#view logs for all processes 
$ sudo pm2 logs 1	         	#view logs for app 1
$ sudo pm2 logs --json               	#view logs for all processes in JSON format
$ sudo pm2 flush			#flush all logs
```

## To manage the PM2 process, use the following commands.

```
$ sudo pm2 startup            #enable PM2 to start at system boot
$ sudo pm2 startup systemd    #or explicitly specify systemd as startup system 
$ sudo pm2 save               #save current process list on reboot
$ sudo pm2 unstartup          #disable PM2 from starting at system boot
$ sudo pm2 update	      #update PM2 package
```
